# Arctic Tern Migration 

![Arctic Tern]("migration_portfolio_post/tern.jpg")





Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) are small seabirds known for having the longest migration of any animal on earth. Every year, these ambitious birds travel from their arctic breeding grounds (places like Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Canada) all the way down to the Antarctic coast. This equates to a round trip of 43,000 miles!

Because of this migration pattern, Artic terns experience more daylight than any species on the planet, living in continuous summer. How nice.

These birds are slender, have long pointed wings, and a forked tail. Their shape allows them to be efficient, and agile fliers. Adults have a black cap on their head, and a brightly colored orange and red beak. The majority of their feathers are white and grey.

Arctic terns are social birds, they spend their time in colonies with other terns. They nest in costal areas, where they lay 1-3 eggs on bare ground. Arctic terns feed on small fish and marine invertebrates.
