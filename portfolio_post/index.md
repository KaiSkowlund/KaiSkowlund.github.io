### [Annual Temperature Trend](https://KaiSkowlund.github.io/portfolio_post/annual_temperature_trend.html)

This plot indicates the temperature trend in New York City from 1900-2024. This trend indicates a annual change of 0.01460 degrees Celius per year, and a esitmated change of 1.46 degrees C per 100 years.

### [Mean Annual Temperature](https://KaiSkowlund.github.io/portfolio_post/MeanAnnTemp.html)

This plot shows a general temperature trend over the last century, overlayed with a 10 year rolling mean. The data used was sourced from station USW00094728, provided by NOAA. There is an outlier at the last datapoint in the chart, which could have been a faulty reading, or a extreme weather event.This plot indicates a trend in rising average temperature due to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions since the 1800s. Creating this same chart with a larger sample size of temperature readings from earlier dates, could give us a better picture of the overall trend. The interpretation of this graph is limited by it's date range.
