# Climate Change Portfolio Post 

## New York City Temperature Data (1900-2024)

Climate change in New York City is primarily driven by the buildup of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, from human activities like burning fossil fuels, transportation, and industrial manufacturing. These properties of these gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise. In NYC, this leads to hotter summers, more frequent heatwaves, rising sea levels, and increased flooding risks, especially in low-lying coastal areas. Urbanization and the heat island effect amplify these impacts. The position of the station used in this report may have been influenced by this. Climate change also disrupts weather patterns, increasing the intensity of storms and precipitation events. 

### [Annual Temperature Trend](https://KaiSkowlund.github.io/portfolio_post/annual_temperature_trend.html)

This plot indicates the temperature trend in New York City from 1900-2024. This trend indicates a annual change of 0.01460 degrees Celius per year, and a esitmated change of 1.46 degrees C per 100 years. These changes can be attributed to global greenhouse gass emissions, that have increased since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s.


### [Mean Annual Temperature](https://KaiSkowlund.github.io/portfolio_post/MeanAnnTemp.html)

This plot shows a general temperature trend over the last century, overlayed with a 10 year rolling mean. The data used was sourced from station USW00094728, provided by NOAA. There is an outlier at the last datapoint in the chart, which could have been a faulty reading, or a extreme weather event. This plot indicates a trend in rising average temperature due to a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions since the 1800s. Creating this same chart with a larger sample size of temperature readings from earlier dates, could give us a better picture of the overall trend. The interpretation of this graph is limited by it's date range.
